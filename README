This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Replace this README file with notes on your implementation.
Mentions any special features or limitations.


Reminders:
	1. how to compile and run?
			$make
			$./profsh -t test.sh

	2. One very confusing thing is 
			char** word;
	   in "struct command" of command-internals.h.

	   It means even the simple command can contains several lines, one example can be like this:
	   		a  \
	   		<b \
	   		>c

	   And that's why there are double stars here for the word, so I use the following array of string to store the string of command:
	   		char cmd_string[MAX_LINE_OF_SINGLE_COMMAND][MAX_SIZE_OF_COMMAND];

	3. For now, I just seperate the commands by newline... but you can still test many of the example in test.sh...
